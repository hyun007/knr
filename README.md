# The C Programming Language Exercises
This is just a record of my progress of the exercises through the classic 
book: K&R's "The C Programming Language." There are many like it, but this
is mine.

One of my personal rules while i work through the exercises of this book 
is to not use the internet to look up obstacles that i may encounter along
the way
